# Next steps

## For admin/repo creator

Review the [template guide](https://t-squared.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/)
for more information on how to use the template and the next steps after copying
the project. Open a terminal, ideally done right after creating the project from
the template with `uvx copier`, and run these commands:

- `git init -b main` to create the project as a Git repository.
- `git add . && git commit -m "start of new project"` to add the files to the Git history.
- `gh repo create dp-next/wp2-a-preg-predict-t2d --source=. --public --push` to
  create the GitHub repository from this project.

Or in an easy copy-paste format:

```
git init -b main && git add . && git commit -m "start of project" && gh repo create dp-next/wp2-a-preg-predict-t2d --source=. --public --push
```

Then, either ask Luke to do the next steps or optionally install the
[`spaid`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/spaid) CLI tool and run these
setup steps:

- `spaid_gh_set_repo_settings -h` to set the repository settings.
- `spaid_gh_ruleset_basic_protect_main -h` to protect the main branch.
- `spaid_team_add_repo dp-next research-projects-team wp2-a-preg-predict-t2d` to add the repository to the team.
- `spaid_team_add_user dp-next research-projects-team USERNAME` to add the researcher to the team.

The GitHub repository and project is now all set for the researcher to take
over! (you can also delete this section too)

## For researcher

- Review all TODO items in this file and throughout the project files that have
  a `TODO` tag.
- Review the README files to better understand the file and folder structure.
- Update the main README file with a description of the project (one of the TODO
  items).
- Fill out the `dp-next.yaml` file with information about this project. This
  file helps the managers and coordinators to keep track of what's going on and
  what the progress is for all the projects.
